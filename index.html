                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    As a communications professional with a background in ministry and education, I bring a unique blend
                    of creativity, leadership, and spiritual insight to every project I undertake. My journey has taken me
                    from academic chaplaincy to youth ministry and now into strategic communications,and I have approached
                    every step along the way with a deep commitment to clarity, empathy, and purpose.
